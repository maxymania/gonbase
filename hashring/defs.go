/*
An implementation of consistent hashing or hash-rings, specifically, static,
non-migrating hash-rings. These rings are static and non-migrating by not
being designed to change at runtime (no insertion or removal of nodes).
This departs this implementation from other hash-ring systems, that are
designed to dynamically distribute data onto a cluster while nodes are
constantly being added and removed.

This implementation is designed with empathis on systems, in which "nodes"
have limited disk-space while storing a dataset that possibly exceeds their
disk-capacity, rendering certain "nodes" incapable to store further records.

In order not to loose those records, techniques such as those similar to
Cuckoo-Hashing are applied.
